# General Assembly - Project 1

# Project Info:
  This was my first project at General Assembly's Immersive Program. The task given to me was to create a working, interactive, non-trivial gam, that included one CSS animation/ transition fired by a DOM event, be styled with CSS, and use flexbox or CSS grid for the layout and positioning.
