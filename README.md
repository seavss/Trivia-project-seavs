# General Assembly - Project 1

## Project Info
  This was my first project at General Assembly's Immersive Program. The task given to me was to create a working, interactive, non-trivial gam, that included one CSS animation/ transition fired by a DOM event, be styled with CSS, and use flexbox or CSS grid for the layout and positioning.

### Description

### Technologies Used

HTML and CSS for the website and Javascript for question/answer part.

Problems with implementation: The answers are not in a,b,c format, they are clicked on and the color background changes. And I would need to load random questions, not the same ones in the same order.

Solution: The answer fields can be styled using CSS by having buttons and changing the color on hover and click. I could store at least 20 questions in the array and then use Math.random for the array length to churn out random questions.
